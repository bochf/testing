Running without a timer tick means the kernel does less work when idle and can potentially save power because it does not have to wake up regularly just to service the timer.

		It further helps determine if packets should be delivered by Layer 2 (switched) or Layer 3 (routed) means.
		Digging deeper: the binary AND of the IP Address and the Netmask is a mathematical transformation that yields the Subnet.  This relationship can be used to determine if any 2 addresses are members of the same Subnet.
