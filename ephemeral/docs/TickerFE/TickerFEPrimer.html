    <p class="arttitle">A Short Primer on Ticker &amp; Feed Terminology</p>
    <!-- <p class="artstitle">for system administrators and non-developers</p> -->

    <p class="artsstitle">Version: 1.0.1</p>

    <!-- <p class="footnote"><span class="textbf">Note:</span> Some of the terms are used as concepts, operational processes, and commands. I have tried to differentiate the usage when possible. But the distinctions are sometimes elusive as the terminology is frequently reused in multiple contexts.</p> -->

     <!-- <hr style="width: 90%;" /> --><!-- =========================================================== -->

    <p class="defblock"><span class="textbf">Blackhole</span> - This is a ticket that is held open to consume repeated alarms. The &quot;{Blackhole}&quot; string is typically found in the title of the ticket.</p>

    <p class="defblock"><span class="textbf oscmd">chase</span> - Chase is a script that moves fallback and monitoring to another machine in the same flavor. Chase includes safety checks and attempts to do the correct things with monitoring and fallback-master/submaster. <span class="oscmd">chase</span> is used here as a reference to a script. It is also used in an action/verb context where monitors are &quot;chased&quot; - This refers to moving the designated monitor from one system to another.</p>

    <p class="defblock"><span class="textbf">Contributor pricing</span> - This is a method (primarily for fixed income instruments) where pricing is provided by multiple sources. Information is fed from multiple sources and the user may choose to filter the Pricing Contributor Source (PCS). Compare with Exchange Pricing.</p>

    <p class="defblock"><span class="textbf oscmd">copyblk</span> - This is the process to copy the front end stream position of one ticker to another. This is needed when syncing data from one ticker to another. Note: This only applies for tkrsender and <span class="textit">not</span> xreceiver</p>

    <p class="defblock"><span class="textbf">Day-0</span> - This is data for today. History is divided into regular, deep and superdeep. Regular history is located on SAN storage of normal ticker plant machines. Deep is located on NFS, attached to normal ticker plants. Super deep is located on NFS, attached to a separate set of machines dedicated to serving these requests. Normally break down is 0-30 Regular (in order to speed up GIP 30), 31-~280 deep, ~60- year 2008 super deep. NOTE: Ticker is moving more towards a &quot;tier&quot; based terminology and the breakdown will change.</p><!-- This is data for today. &quot;History&quot; is days 1 - 29. &quot;Deep&quot; is days 30 - 235. &quot;Superdeep&quot; is days 30 to the first data. deepmasters and sdeepmasters are responsible for writing historical data, while simple deep and sdeep systems are read-only of the data. Data is rolled from (SAN based) Day-29 files to (NFS based) deep/sdeep files via the <span class="oscmd">disk_shuffle</span> command.== http://itickersweb.corp.bloomberg.com/wiki/index.php/Sdeep_/_Superdeep -->

    <p class="defblock"><span class="textbf oscmd">disk_shuffle</span> - A script that moves date based files around (pre-creates new, deletes old, migrates to NFS).</p>

    <p class="defblock"><span class="bbtermcmd">ECO</span> - This is a calendar of economic releases. Watching these releases can give some indication of pending market volatility and heavy volume days.</p>

    <p class="defblock"><span class="bbtermcmd">EPCM</span> - Ticker Plant (and FE) capacity monitor. Displays stats such as %idle, tick rate, and current monitor for tickers. Displays %idle and system state for FE systems.</p>

    <p class="defblock"><span class="bbtermcmd">EPLA</span> - This is a terminal function to view front end and ticker latencies by flavor, exchange, and type.</p>

    <p class="defblock"><span class="textbf">Exchange pricing</span> - This is a method (primarily for equities) where an exchange provides pricing information. This is a single stream from an <span class="textit">authoritative</span> source. Compare with Contributor Pricing.</p>
