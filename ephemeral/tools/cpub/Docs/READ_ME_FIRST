================================================================================
CPUBUsersGuide.html is the best place to start.

WritingAProvider.html is the next place to go.

Both of these are fairly well maintained.

WritingAWriter.txt is a bit old but should be fairly solid. It will remain as
a "backwater text file" for the forseeable future as there is not expected to
be a lot of interest in coding on writers at this time.

The FrameworkDesign.txt document contains "conversations" that go a bit beyond
what can be found in the comments. I have tried to keep the dicussion in the
comments with the code, but some are large and require a bit larger treatment,
so I have broken them out into this file. This file should be read WITH the
source.
