No formalized documentation exists at this time. So I created this.

 core.icount    A simple counter that increments on each iteration
 core.nctime    A localtime() string with no colons. Confoms to ISO-8601
 core.ctime     String output from ctime() --> wall time
 core.utime     The Unix epoch offset. Straight from time()
 core.timeval   gettimeofday() high resolution timestamp
 core.timespec  clock_gettime() high(er) resolution timestamp
