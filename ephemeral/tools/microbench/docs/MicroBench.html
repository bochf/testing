 	<!-- ================================================================= -->
   <p class="subjhead">Introduction &amp; Purpose</p>

	<!-- ======================== -->
	<p class="subjsect">The Problem</p>

    <p class="subjcont">Frequently we are required to understand a performance failure in a system based on a very transient situation, and then relate that failure to a vendor so they can address the shortcoming. We face similar situations when trying to understand what that problem looks like through our tools, or why our tools do not capture what we are looking for with sufficient clarity.</p>

    <p class="subjcont">We seek a means to quickly develop load generation tools that can capture the performance characteristic of the problem and then use later to benchmark, to communicate the nature of the issue, or determine if the problem still exists after remediation efforts.</p>
	
	<!-- ======================== -->
	<p class="subjsect">The Proposed Solution</p>

    <p class="subjcont">The MicroBench framework is a lightweight <span class="textit">framework</span> for launching simulated load against a system. The primary purposes of this framework are to simulate system stress, assist in tool development, develop test cases, to provide learning opportunities, and to promote reuse through a consistent interface.</p>

    <p class="subjcont">A well-designed framework allows for rapid module creation, without forcing the developer to code to an overly complex set of requirements and APIs. This proposed framework (library of functionality) is designed with this goal in mind.</p>
	
    <p class="subjcont">A minimalist framework allows us to quickly code up exportable test cases that can be sent outside the company without the risk of exposing IP. The build of a module can be reduced to just a few source files - or even a library to link against. This limits the exposed source to just the problem at hand and potentially the framework code (if source is passed instead of a pre-built library).</p>
	
	<!-- ======================== -->
	<p class="subjsect">Build vs. Buy</p>

    <p class="subjcont">The value of &quot;buy&quot; appeals to saving group resources from the costs of development efforts. The upside of buy is that there may be minimal acquisition costs, and those may be simply a matter of getting an open source package through BOSS. The view here is that while there may be development costs, that development effort rewards the developer with insight into the system that cannot simply be gained through simply <span class="textit">running</span> a pre-packaged tool.</p>

    <p class="subjcont">Modules are designed to mimic characteristics of Bloomberg production code. This may mean writing <span class="textit">poor</span> code and then devising means to improve the algorithms and APIs used, tuning our tool skills to detect when code is not running optimally, and finally to find optimal OS tuning or fixes to remediate the problem.</p>	
	
	<!-- ================================================================= -->
	<p class="subjhead">Theory of Design</p>

    <p class="subjcont">Design of the framework is limited to two sets of APIs. Instead of providing a massive feature set to cover every situation, the intent is to simplify the coding of a module, and then outsource the majority of the framework to pre-existing Unix tools that can be used to orchestrate module runs. For example; individual modules are launched with a minimalist &quot;config script&quot;, while a series of module launches are orchestrated via a shell script that starts each of the modules.</p>
	
	<!--
    <p class="subjcont">The purpose of the API library is to simplify coding for the module writer without also encumbering him with a bunch of <span class="textit">requirements</span> to code to. Option parsing and output verbosity are the two areas of the framework API.</p>
	-->
	
	<p class="subjcont">Instead of writing a beefy framework to control module startup, the design allows each module config to be called from a shell script much like a program. The shell provides for capabilities such as module grouping, conditional runs, staggered starts of modules, and potentially multiple module instantiations.</p>

	<!-- ================================================================= -->
	<p class="subjhead">Module &quot;Config Scripts&quot;</p>

	<p class="subjcont">Module configs are designed to be fed to the file as a file name parameter or read via stdin. They rely on two reserved words: &quot;<span class="texttt">set</span>&quot; and &quot; <span class="texttt">go</span>&quot;. <span class="texttt">set</span> is used to establish a key-value pair that the module will use for a configurable parameter. <span class="texttt">go</span> tells the parser to cease parsing, and begin execution of the module. The end of the config script is an implicit  <span class="texttt">go</span>.</p>
	
	<p class="subjcont"><span class="texttt">go</span> is the implicit terminating condition. If the <span class="texttt">eval</span> keyword is used instead, then the library will exit after parsing all input with a message indicating success or not in parsing required paramaters. So, by replacing <span class="texttt">go</span> with <span class="texttt">eval</span>, you can cause the params to be <span class="textit">tested</span> but the module will not actually run.</p>

	<p class="subjcont">The primary method<span class="reference">1</span> of passing data is the key value pair. This can capture boolean (flag), integer (numeric), and string data. While this simplifies option parsing, the greater benefit is collecting the large number of module options into a file that can then be used to define a specific load characteristic. These can be joined (via scripting) to simulate even more complex <span class="textit">personalities</span> that approximate entire application loads.</p>

	<p class="footnote">[1. The potential alternative is to pass a filename in a key value pair that would feed in more complex data such as a large data set that the module would utilize to generate a specific load. ]</p>

Ideally, hashes should begin comments so that it is clear to the reader what is happening.</td>

        <td class="listtd">Parsing of the file stops at the <span class="texttt">go</span> directive.

	<p class="subjhead">Writing a Module</p>
	
	<!-- ======================== -->
	<p class="subjsect">Planning</p>
 
 	<p class="subjcont">There is no hard definition of what a module <span class="textit">should</span> do. The thinking is that most work in this area is rather ad-hoc with compile time options modifying behaviour to suit a <span class="textit">current</span> need. A module that measures ops today, might be used for low-grade background noise tomorrow. The goal of the framework is to simplify some of the more mundane aspects of this normal process.</p>
	
 	<p class="subjcont">When writing your module, you should consider three potential modes that it may run in: ops per period (timed full-bore run with statistics), max capacity (unbounded full-bore run), and background noise (a paced number of operations). While each of these may not be today's problem, they may be part of tomorrow's needs, so coding should allow for future extensions.</p>

	<!-- ======================== -->
	<p class="subjsect">Library API</p>

	<p class="subjcont">This API is available through including the individual header files and then linking against the library (object) file. Additional information can be found in the function prototype definitions in the header files. There is a sample module (sampmod) in the framework that can serve as an example template to copy from. (Note: The sampmod module utilizes some aspects of the API that should not be required for most modules. See the comments in the code for specifics.)</p>

	<p class="subjsect">Notes on Authoring Modules</p>
	
	<p class="subjcont">Key names and value data are both limited in size by the respective <span class="texttt">MAX_LABEL_SIZE</span> and <span class="texttt">MAX_VALUE_SIZE</span> defines. Data structures to hold string values should use these defines to stay in sync with changes to the library.</p>
	
	<p class="subjcont">The design of the framework allows for modules written in Perl, Python, Shell, or other languages - although the library is currently only available in C.</p>
	
	<p class="subjcont">Key labels are stored in all-caps. When requesting a value from the <span class="texttt">GetOptionValue()</span> functions, the key should be expressed in all-caps. Values are stored in the original case specified in the config script file. Of course case sensitive values only matter for string data.</p>
	
	<p class="subjcont">The design of the option parsing logic is such that the module developer does not need to handle input errors and exceptions. One only needs to call the functions and <span class="textit">assume</span> that they work. This is because they will print and error message and exit when encountering an exception. This means that the <span class="texttt">GetOptionValue()</span> calls will never return an invalid / error code - either it passes, or it exits.</p>
	
	<!-- ================================================================= -->
	<p class="subjhead">Modules In The Framework</p>

    <p class="subjcont">As of this writing there are a number of modules in the framework that were used for <span class="textit">recent</span> performance testing with the new Power 8 systems. The intent is to develop a <span class="textit">sufficient</span> parsing and verbosity library to handle most needs. Once we have achieved that we can begin to hang the naturally occurring flow of test cases and load tools on what has been built.</p>
	
    <p class="subjcont">Current efforts can be found in the git ephemeral repo under: <span class="texttt">perf/ephemeral/tools/microbench</span>.</p>
