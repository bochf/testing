The majority of the "low level" work here is done in the procperf libary.
This is loosely based on the AIX perfstat libary. The ugliness of reading
the Linux /proc file system is hidden by that library.

The code in *this* directory is laid out in a few major sections:
 options - Parsing and presentation of user options
 gather  - Get the stats
 munge   - Calculate the stats
 scatter - Display the stats

The key structures passed around here are:
 options - Defined in options.h - Holds user options/defaults
 cpu_list - Defined in gather.h - Holds all the CPU stats

The x86 Linux version of this code is different than the LoP version in that
it does a re-ordering of the CPUs in the system.
