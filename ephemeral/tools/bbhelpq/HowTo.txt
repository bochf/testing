This is a quick HowTo / FAQ / About file for bbhelpq.

What is bbhelpq?

It is a query tool that will run queries against flat files. The purpose of
these files is to provide basic "help" for finding appropriate commands in
the Bloomberg environment.

The files queried are (generally) well formatted and specific to this need.

Why write a C binary tool like this?

The point was to create a "drop in" database where new files could be 
dropped in without changes to the code that is used to query & display
results.

Parsing lots of small files could be a bit difficult / slow with shell so
a C binary was created. Furthermore, the source files can be "compiled" to
a single file that is mmap()ed into memory and accessed as a single syscall
instead of "lots" of open()s, read()s, lseek()s, and close()s.

The intent was to write a tool that provides a "query-like" capability so
that it could be wrapped in some sort of "browser" tool.

The options to list keys and names are just methods to find more restrictive
drill-in options.
