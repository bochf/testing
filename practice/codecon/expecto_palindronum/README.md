A **palindrome** is a word that reads the same backward and forward. 

Given a **string S**, you are allowed to convert it to a palindrome by adding 0 or more characters in front of it. 

Find the length of the **shortest palindrome** that you can create from S by applying the above transformation. 

# Input Specifications
Your program will take
* A string **S ( 1 ≤ Length(S) ≤ 100)** where each character of S will be a lowercase alphabet (Between 'a' to 'z')

# Output Specifications
For each input, print out **an integer L** denoting the length of the shortest palindrome you can generate from S.

# Sample Input/Output
## INPUT
```
baaa
```
## OUTPUT
```
7
```
## EXPLANATION
```
The shortest palindrome you can construct from 'baaa' is 'aaabaaa'.
